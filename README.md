# Class-3-Project
Coursera Data Scientist Specialization course project
1. Merge test and training data sets together
2. Use the sql package to filter the features table to only return variables related to mean and standard deviation
3. Use sql to subset the data set with only the columns from the results of the query above
4. Merge the test and training labels together. These tables identify the activities. 
5. Column bind the merged labels with the data set
6. Rename the first column of the data set Activity ID
7. Rename the columns of the activites table. 
8. Merge the activities table with the data set so that now the data set includes a column with the activity
9. Rename the data set with descriptive variable names
10. Merge the test and training subject tables
11. Column bind the subjects and the data set so that now the data set includes a column with the subject
12. Rename the first column of the data set Subject
13. Use the dplyr package to create the final results
14. Write the results to a text file

I know there is probably a better, more efficient way to accomplish this but this is the best I could come with given the time constraints. Thanks and happy grading!
